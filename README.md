- Personal information (address, date of birth)
- Emergency contact information
- Employment date tracking

### Testing with Postman

To test the employee API endpoints:

1. Import the provided Postman collection
2. Ensure the server is running locally
3. Execute requests in the following order:
   - Create an employee
   - Retrieve all employees
   - Retrieve specific employee by ID
   - Update employee information
   - Search for employees by criteria
   - Delete an employee

### MongoDB Queries

Direct MongoDB queries for employee data management are available in the project documentation folder.

### Technologies Used

- Mongoose for data modeling
- Express.js for API routing
- MongoDB for data storage
- Postman for API testing
